1.FSDataInputStream
              >Provides stream  for reading data.
              >Initially when client invokes open() method,the namenode returns the metadata with FSDatainputStream
              >It contains the DFSInputStream to which the client send the read() signals.
2.DFSInputStream
              >Handles communication of the namenode with various datanodes.
              >this reads the data from the datanodes when client sends a read() signal
              >this is repeated until the client sends a close() signal.
              >Handles integrity of data contained by the blocks.
              >Manages data read activity in case of datanode failure.
              >Called internally by FSDataInputStream.
3.FSDataOutputStream
             > Provides stream (channel) for writing data.
             >Initially when client invokes create() method,the namenode checks the existency of the file and returns the 
             new location for the file or if it already existing ,it returns an IOException.
             >This inturn helps the client by providing DFSOutputStream that helps to write the file on hdfs.
4.DFSOutputStream
             > Handles communication of the namenode with various datanodes.
             >this create packets  using the data and store it in the ack queue
             >it performs replication by filing the datanode pipelines
             >even in case of failure in writing ,it informs the name node and reinitiates the writing process with the new location.
             > Called internally by FSDataOutputStream.
